    <p>Clash of Clans is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell.The game was releases for IOS platforms on August 2,2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7,2013.Clash of Clans has been constantly evolving to offer more user-friendly, consistent and fun online experiences for Supercell gamers. There have been countless updates since the game launched in 2012.There’s no simple recipe or magic formula to achieve our dream. What we do know, however, is that without players Supercell doesn’t exist. Creating lovable worlds and characters that players want to come back to over and over again is at the heart of how we design and operate our games.</p>
